# Slots Ideas and Notes

Misc ideas and notes about slot machine computer/mobile games

## Ideas ##

* "Row of Machines" multi-player online
* Contest/competition-based business model (see below)
* "Difficulty" setting: e.g. Hard/Vegas/Easy/Silly
* "Heater" hot streak mode that changes pay tables

## Contest/competition-based business model

Instead of slots focused on running people out of money (so they have to buy credits), focus on getting people to pay to compete for big prizes in tournaments/challenges/etc.
